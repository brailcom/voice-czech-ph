Installation instructions for voice-czech-ph
============================================

* Prerequisities

This voice works with Festival 1.4.3 or higher.

voice-czech-ph contains just a Czech voice.  To synthesize something, you need
festival-czech package providing Czech support for Festival.  festival-czech is
available from http://www.freebsoft.org/festival-czech .  To install it, follow
its installation instructions.

* Building the voice

If you install from the binary distribution, skip this step.

In order to build the voice data, make sure you have the following additional
software installed:

- Festvox 2.0, available from http://www.festvox.org/download.html .

- Edinburgh Speech Tools (Debian package speech-tools).

Then just invoke `make'.  If it fails, it is most likely because you don't have
installed all the tools mentioned above or you don't have properly set and
exported the environment variables ESTDIR and FESTVOXDIR (they should point to
the Edinburgh Speech Tools and Festvox installation directories respectively).

* Installing the voice

Run `make install'.  You may want to look at the beginning of Makefile
(variable `festival_voices_path') to adjust the installation path before
running the command.

* Running the voice

Start Festival and call:

  (voice_czech_ph)

Now Festival should speak Czech!
