Installation instructions for voice-czech-ph
============================================

* Prerequisities

In order to install and use this voice, you need the following software:

- Festival 1.4.3 or higher.

- Festvox 2.0, available from http://www.festvox.org/download.html .

- Edinburgh Speech Tools (Debian package speech-tools).

- Sufficiently recent version of festival-czech, available from
  http://www.freebsoft.org/festival-czech .

* Building the necessary files

Just invoke `make'.

If it fails, this most likely because you don't have installed all the tools
mentioned above or you don't have properly set and exported the environment
variables ESTDIR and FESTVOXDIR (they should point to the Edinburgh Speech
Tools and Festvox installation directories respectively).

* Installing the voice

Run `make install'.  You may want to look at the beginning of Makefile to
adjust the installation path before running the command.

* Running the voice

Start Festival and call:

  (voice_czech_ph)

Now Festival should speak Czech!
