Czech Festival Voice

This package contains a complete Czech diphone voice for Festival, including
all files and tools necessary for its further development.

You can find installation instructions in the file INSTALL.

The way the package was created is thoroughly documented in the subdirectory
`doc' (in Czech only for now).  Anybody who wants to create another Czech
diphone voice for Festival can follow that documentation.
